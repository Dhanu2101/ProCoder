    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> What is Front-end?</h2><br>
    <p><b>The “front-end languages” live in the browser. After you type an address into the address bar at the top and
            hit the enter/return key, your browser will receive at least an HTML file from the web server. That file
            will likely tell the browser to request a CSS file and a JavaScript file as well (probably many more than
            one, but we’ll keep it simple).

            Each of these languages performs a separate but very important function and they work harmoniously together
            to determine how the web page is STRUCTURED (HTML), how it LOOKS (CSS), and how it FUNCTIONS (JavaScript).
            And keep in mind that your browser handles figuring out how to make these files into a functioning web page
            (not the server).

            Front-end web development is NOT design (you won’t be playing around in Photoshop or anything), but a
            front-end developer does apply the work of designers to the web page by translating their well-designed
            layouts into real code. The front-end developer stands between the designer on one end and the back-end
            developer on the other, translating the design into code and plugging the data from the back-end developer
            into the right spots. They must also handle all the possible interactions that the user may need to make
            with the page.

            On the front end, you will need to be highly conscious of who your user is and how they will be interacting
            with your web page, because you are building their gateway to your page or product. This may mean gaining a
            strong understanding of accessibility and things like responsive development down the line, but first you
            need to build up your toolkit and pick up the fundamentals of the front-end languages.

            In the following lessons, you’ll get a healthy understanding of each of the three front-end languages. To

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Advantages Of Front-end</h2><br>
    Advantages:<br>

    <b>Speedy Development and User-driven Outcomes. Using certain modern frameworks will enable faster development of
        elements. ...
        Secured. ...
        Quickly Reacting Features and Apps. ...
        Easy to Learn, Use and Scale Technologies. ...
        Powerful Features and Layouts. ...
        Real-time Programming.</b> <br>
    <br>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">What are the benefits of using a front-end framework?</h2><br>
    <p><b>
        One of the biggest benefits that you get out of a framework is the link between your data and the presentation.
        Without it, when you update the variable in your code, it’s not automatically updating in the HTML. If the
        variable updates you need to manually re-update the DOM and frameworks do this procedure very easy using the
        two-way binding.

        Some people who primarily learned and work with frameworks sometimes are being confused about something not
        updating on the screen when they update their data.

        You can build things that will do that updating procedure for you without a framework but then you suddenly
        realize that you’ve built up your own little framework.

        Another thing about using a front-end framework is the seamless routing and page transitions. Generally, when
        you click on the page, the browser has to go out and fetch a whole new page, do a full page refresh and show it
        to the user. But sometimes there were very few changes on the page and the browser has to do a lot of
        unnecessary work to grab that new thing when half of your page might not be updating anyway.

        Front-end frameworks can take care of your routing and page loading so that now you don’t need to do a full page
        refresh every single time. This is really cool and allows for things like animated transitions between pages. It
        makes your website behave more like an app.

        Yet another reason you might need a front-end framework is that you need to have an opinionated way to handle
        complexity. Some people don’t like this, but if you work in a large team, having a strictly defined structure of
        your app is a good choice, because otherwise, you’ll just make a spaghetti mess out of all of the code that you
        write.

        You’re just doing things faster when you’re able to reach for the framework. You reach for all these
        battle-tested libraries, they’ve been checked for security, they’re in use on a thousand of different websites,
        they’ve been checked for performance, edge case bugs, so you don’t have to find those bugs over and over again
        because they’re already been found and fixed.

        And if you don’t want to have all that JavaScript that’s coming down the line, you can use frameworks like
        Svelte, which disappears after you compiled everything.
