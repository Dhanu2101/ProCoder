    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> What is Python?</h2><br>
    <p><b>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy
            emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well
            as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale
            projects.[30]

            Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
            structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described
            as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[31]

            Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language,
            and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new
            features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python 3.0
            was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and
            much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in
            2020</b></p>


    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Libraries?</h2><br>


    <b>Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths,[113] provides tools suited to
        many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are
        supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases,
        generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,[114] manipulating regular
        expressions, and unit testing.

        Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface
        (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333[115]), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code,
        internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python
        code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.

        As of March 2021, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software,
        contains over 290,000[116] packages with a wide range of functionality, including:
        <br>
        Automation<br>
        Data analytics<br>
        Databases<br>
        Documentation<br>
        Graphical user interfaces<br>
        Image processing<br>
        Machine learning<br>
        Mobile App<br>

        Computer Networking<br>
        Scientific computing<br>
        System administration<br>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>7 Reasons Why You Must Consider Writing Software Applications in Python</h2><br>
    <p>1) Readable and Maintainable Code<br>
        While writing a software application, you must focus on the quality of its source code to simplify maintenance
        and updates. The syntax rules of Python allow you to express concepts without writing additional code. At the
        same time, Python, unlike other programming languages, emphasizes on code readability, and allows you to use
        English keywords instead of punctuations. Hence, you can use Python to build custom applications without writing
        additional code. The readable and clean code base will help you to maintain and update the software without
        putting extra time and effort.<br>
        2) Multiple Programming Paradigms<br>
        Like other modern programming languages, Python also supports several programming paradigm. It supports object
        oriented and structured programming fully. Also, its language features support various concepts in functional
        and aspect-oriented programming. At the same time, Python also features a dynamic type system and automatic
        memory management. The programming paradigms and language features help you to use Python for developing large
        and complex software applications.<br>
        3) Compatible with Major Platforms and Systems<br>
        At present, Python is supports many operating systems. You can even use Python interpreters to run the code on
        specific platforms and tools. Also, Python is an interpreted programming language. It allows you to you to run
        the same code on multiple platforms without recompilation. Hence, you are not required to recompile the code
        after making any alteration. You can run the modified application code without recompiling and check the impact
        of changes made to the code immediately. The feature makes it easier for you to make changes to the code without
        increasing development time.<br>
        4) Robust Standard Library<br>
        Its large and robust standard library makes Python score over other programming languages. The standard library
        allows you to choose from a wide range of modules according to your precise needs. Each module further enables
        you to add functionality to the Python application without writing additional code. For instance, while writing
        a web application in Python, you can use specific modules to implement web services, perform string operations,
        manage operating system interface or work with internet protocols. You can even gather information about various
        modules by browsing through the Python Standard Library documentation.<br>
        5) Many Open Source Frameworks and Tools<br>
        As an open source programming language, Python helps you to curtail software development cost significantly. You
        can even use several open source Python frameworks, libraries and development tools to curtail development time
        without increasing development cost. You even have option to choose from a wide range of open source Python
        frameworks and development tools according to your precise needs. For instance, you can simplify and speedup web
        application development by using robust Python web frameworks like Django, Flask, Pyramid, Bottle and Cherrypy.
        Likewise, you can accelerate desktop GUI application development using Python GUI frameworks and toolkits like
        PyQT, PyJs, PyGUI, Kivy, PyGTK and WxPython.<br>
        6) Simplify Complex Software Development<br>
        Python is a general purpose programming language. Hence, you can use the programming language for developing
        both desktop and web applications. Also, you can use Python for developing complex scientific and numeric
        applications. Python is designed with features to facilitate data analysis and visualization. You can take
        advantage of the data analysis features of Python to create custom big data solutions without putting extra time
        and effort. At the same time, the data visualization libraries and APIs provided by Python help you to visualize
        and present data in a more appealing and effective way. Many Python developers even use Python to accomplish
        artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing tasks.<br>
        7) Adopt Test Driven Development<br>
        You can use Python to create prototype of the software application rapidly. Also, you can build the software
        application directly from the prototype simply by refactoring the Python code. Python even makes it easier for
        you to perform coding and testing simultaneously by adopting test driven development (TDD) approach. You can
        easily write the required tests before writing code and use the tests to assess the application code
        continuously. The tests can also be used for checking if the application meets predefined requirements based on
        its source code.<br>
        However, Python, like other programming languages, has its own shortcomings. It lacks some of the built-in
        features provided by other modern programming language. Hence, you have to use Python libraries, modules, and
        frameworks to accelerate custom software development. Also, several studies have shown that Python is slower
        than several widely used programming languages including Java and C++. You have to speed up the Python
        application by making changes to the application code or using custom runtime. But you can always use Python to
        speed up software development and simplify software maintenance.</b></p>
