    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> What is Web-Development?</h2><br>
    <p><b>Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet
            (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text
            to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list
            of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content
            development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security
            configuration, and e-commerce development.

            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
            sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
            content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

            For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
            developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
            organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
            related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a
            collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three
            kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.
            Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end
            developers deal with the servers</b></p>


    <h2 style="text-align: center;">7 Reasons You Should Learn Web Development</h2><br>

        <br>
        3 No Wasted Time in Learning How to Code<br>
        If you're serious about learning how to code, there are several options for web dev education. You can do a CS degree, teach yourself online, or do a bootcamp. All are great options; it really depends on how quickly you want to get out into the workforce. The benefit of bootcamp is that you can know how to code, and code well, in 13 weeks. 13 weeks! It's an intense 13 weeks, but you will have people dedicated to your success in learning and finding a job throughout your bootcamp experience. Before you know it, you'll be in a career you're finally excited about!

        <br>
        5 You Can Work at an Awesome Tech Company<br>
        Tech is where to be right now. Because there is such a high demand for web developers and so little trained developers to fill those positions, tech companies are doing an excellent job at making work like very comfortable, if not enjoyable. If you choose to work for a tech company as a web developer, you'll enjoy free food, ping pong, and rad coworkers.
        <br>

Once you join the web dev community, you will find that there are plenty of opportunities for you to freelance. Coming right out of bootcamp, you can charge $50 an hour—depending on where you live—for your work. And, that will only increase as you become more skilled. 
        <br>
        7 It's Creative and Fun<br>
        Web development gives you the opportunity to express yourself creatively on the internet. If you have an idea you would like to try as you discover your web dev skills, try it out. Web dev is a fun, creative experience.
        <br>
