    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> What is JAVA?</h2><br>
    <p><b>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
            implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
            application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
            platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[17] Java applications are typically compiled
            to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer
            architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of
            them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that
            are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular
            programming languages in use according to GitHub,[18][19] particularly for client-server web applications,
            with a reported 9 million developers.</b></p>


    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Advantages of Java</h2><br>


    <b>Java is easy to learn.
        Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile, debug, and learn than other
        programming languages.

        Java is object-oriented.
        This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.

        Java is platform-independent.
        One of the most significant advantages of Java is its ability to move easily from one computer system to
        another. The ability to run the same program on many different systems is crucial to World Wide Web software,
        and Java succeeds at this by being platform-independent at both the source and binary levels.

        Because of Java's robustness, ease of use, cross-platform capabilities and security features, it has become a
        language of choice for providing worldwide Internet solutions.</b> <br>
    <br>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">How To Learn Java?</h2><br>
    <p><b> Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that was designed by James Gosling at Sun
            Microsystems in 1991. The compilation of the Java applications results in the bytecode that can be run on
            any platform using the Java Virtual Machine. Because of this, Java is also known as a WORA (write once, run
            anywhere) language.

            In modern times, Java is one of the most popular programming languages as it can be used to design
            customized applications that are light and fast and serve a variety of purposes. According to the TIOBE
            Index for April 2019, Java is the number one programming language.Javaâ€™s Popularity and High Salary:
            Java is one of the most popular languages in the world. It is used by some 9 million developers and it runs
            on around 7 billion devices worldwide according to Oracle blogs. Because of the high demand for Java, Java
            developers are also quite sought after and they hold some of the most high-paying jobs in the industry. The
            average salary of a Java Developer lies between $47,169 to $106,610 per year.</b>
